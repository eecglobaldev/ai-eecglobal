---

## ✍️ Content Style Guidelines

### Writing Principles

#### 1. **Professional Yet Human**
- Use professional language but avoid corporate jargon
- Write as if speaking to a friend who needs help
- Show empathy and understanding
- Be encouraging and supportive

**Good Example:**
> "The GS requirement might seem overwhelming at first, but remember: visa officers want to see genuine students who will succeed. Your preparation with this tool shows you're serious about your education. Take a deep breath, and let's break down what they're really looking for."

**Bad Example:**
> "The Genuine Student requirement is a mandatory assessment criterion that evaluates applicant eligibility based on predetermined parameters."

#### 2. **Clear and Specific**
- Use concrete examples relevant to Indian students
- Include specific numbers, dates, and amounts
- Reference real scenarios (e.g., "If you're a Commerce graduate pursuing IT")
- Avoid vague statements

**Good Example:**
> "If you studied Commerce (B.Com) and are now applying for a Master of Data Science, you'll need to explain the connection. For example: 'During my B.Com, I took courses in Business Analytics and worked on projects using Excel and SQL. This sparked my interest in data science, and I want to combine my business knowledge with technical skills to work as a Business Analyst in Mumbai, where salaries range from ₹8-12 lakhs per annum.'"

**Bad Example:**
> "You should explain why you're changing fields."

#### 3. **Actionable and Practical**
- Provide step-by-step guidance
- Include specific actions students can take
- Reference tools, resources, and checklists
- Give examples of what to say/do

**Good Example:**
> "To prepare for financial questions, gather these documents: (1) Your sponsor's ITR for the last 3 years (all pages notarized), (2) Bank statements showing funds held for at least 3 months, (3) Education loan sanction letter if applicable, and (4) CA-certified financial matrix. Practice explaining: 'My father, who works as a Chartered Accountant earning ₹15 lakhs annually, is sponsoring my education. We have ₹40 lakhs in savings accumulated over 5 years, plus an education loan of ₹20 lakhs from SBI.'"

**Bad Example:**
> "You need to show financial documents."

#### 4. **Indian Context Integration**
- Reference Indian cities, universities, job markets
- Use Indian currency (₹) and salary ranges
- Mention Indian companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, etc.)
- Acknowledge family structures and responsibilities
- Reference Indian education system (percentage/CGPA)

**Good Example:**
> "After completing your Master's in Australia, you can return to India and work as a Data Analyst in companies like TCS, Infosys, or Accenture in cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, or Pune. According to Naukri.com, Data Analysts with Australian degrees earn ₹8-15 lakhs per annum in these cities."

**Bad Example:**
> "You can get a good job after graduation."

#### 5. **Balanced and Honest**
- Be honest about challenges and requirements
- Don't oversell or make false promises
- Acknowledge common concerns and address them
- Provide realistic expectations

**Good Example:**
> "Visa processing typically takes 25-30 working days, but during peak intake periods (January-March), it can extend to 60+ days. Don't panic if it takes longer—this is normal. However, if you haven't heard back after 60 days, contact your EEC counsellor who can follow up with the Department of Home Affairs."

**Bad Example:**
> "Your visa will be approved quickly."

## 📋 Examples & Templates

### FAQ Answer Template

```
[Question: What is the exact financial requirement for 2025-2026?]

[Direct Answer - 1-2 sentences]
As of May 2024, the financial requirement for an Australian student visa (Subclass 500) is AUD $29,710 per year for living costs, plus your first year's tuition fees and approximately AUD $2,000 for travel expenses. This means for a typical 2-year Master's program, you'll need to show approximately AUD $60,000-80,000 (₹33-44 lakhs) depending on your course fees.

[Explanation - 3-5 sentences]
The Department of Home Affairs requires this evidence to ensure you can support yourself during your studies without financial hardship. The AUD $29,710 figure is the minimum annual living cost set by the Australian government and covers accommodation, food, transport, and personal expenses. This amount is in addition to your tuition fees, which typically range from AUD $25,000-$50,000 per year depending on your institution and program level. You must also budget for one-time costs like visa application fee (AUD $650), OSHC health insurance (approximately AUD $600-800 per year), and initial travel expenses.

[Examples - 2-3 sentences]
For example, if you're applying for a Master of Information Technology at the University of Melbourne with annual tuition of AUD $45,000, you would need to show: (1) AUD $45,000 for first year tuition, (2) AUD $29,710 for first year living costs, (3) AUD $2,000 for travel, (4) AUD $600 for OSHC, totaling approximately AUD $77,310 (₹42.5 lakhs at current exchange rates). You can demonstrate this through bank statements showing sufficient funds, education loan sanctions, or a combination of both.

[Action Items - 1-2 sentences]
To prepare your financial evidence, gather 6 months of bank statements, your sponsor's ITR for the last 3 years, and any education loan sanction letters. Your EEC counsellor can help you organize these documents into a clear Financial Matrix that visa officers can easily understand.

[Reassurance - 1 sentence]
Remember, showing genuine, accessible funds with clear documentation is key—the amount itself is important, but so is demonstrating that the funds are legitimate and available when needed.
```

### Glossary Term Template

```
Term: CRICOS Code
Abbreviation: CRICOS
Category: Academic

Short Definition:
A unique identifier for every course registered for international students in Australia.

Authoritative Definition:
The Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) code is a mandatory identifier assigned to every course that can be offered to international students in Australia. Every registered course has a unique CRICOS code, typically displayed as a 5-6 digit number. This code ensures that the course meets Australian government quality standards and is eligible for student visa applications. Visa officers verify the CRICOS code on your Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) to confirm you're enrolled in a legitimate, registered course.

Context:
You'll find your CRICOS code on your Offer Letter and CoE. During your GS interview, visa officers may ask about your course details, and knowing your CRICOS code demonstrates that you've researched your course thoroughly and understand its official registration status.

Related Terms:
- CoE (Confirmation of Enrolment)
- Offer Letter
