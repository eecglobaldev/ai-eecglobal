[TARGET_AUDIENCE]
Primary-User: Indian students applying for the Australian Student Visa (Subclass 500).
Secondary-User: Students from other South Asian countries preparing for the GS interview.
User-Journey-Stages-Covered:
-   **Awareness/Research Stage:** Users deciding where to study in Australia (Comprehensive City Comparison).

[CORE_PROBLEM_SOLVED]
The Australian student visa journey is fragmented, complex, and high-stakes. Students face a deluge of generic, often outdated information and lack a single, authoritative resource to guide them from initial planning to successful settlement. This tool solves the critical problem of **information fragmentation and inadequate, non-personalized preparation**. It consolidates the entire journey into a structured, actionable, and AI-powered platform, replacing uncertainty with a clear, step-by-step path to success.

[UNIQUE_VALUE_PROPOSITION]
1.  **Hyper-Personalization Engine:** The AI performs a "Risk Factor Triage" on the user's profile to generate a unique set of interview questions targeting their specific potential weaknesses, rather than using a generic question bank.
2.  **End-to-End Journey Guidance:** The application is more than an interview tool; it is a comprehensive guide covering every critical phase from city selection and document checklists to pre-departure planning and post-arrival tasks.
3.  **Deep GEO & E-E-A-T Fortification:** An advanced, multi-layered schema strategy explicitly defines the application's Expertise (expert authors), Authoritativeness (organizational history), and Trustworthiness (student reviews), while creating a massive local entity graph through its 26 physical branches.
4.  **Voice-Based Realistic Simulation:** Allows users to practice with their voice, simulating the pressure of a real interview, followed by AI transcription and expert analysis of the spoken response.
5.  **Unmatched Specificity:** Delivers highly specific, actionable content, including detailed documentation requirements, city-by-city cost comparisons, and post-arrival checklists that are not found in generic guides.
6.  **100% Free Access & Privacy-First:** Provided by EEC as a commitment to student success. All personal data is processed client-side and is never stored on servers, ensuring complete user privacy.

--- Feature: AI Prep Plan Generation ---
Description: The core strategic function where the AI generates a complete, personalized preparation plan.
Underlying-Prompt-Logic: `createStrategistPrompt` and `createAnswerAndGuidancePrompt` in `geminiService.ts`.
Process:
1.  **Risk Triage:** Analyzes profile for high-risk factors (e.g., previous refusal, recent marriage, study gap, diploma-level study).
2.  **Dynamic Question Generation:** Adjusts the number of questions, adding targeted questions for each identified risk factor.
3.  **Strategic Talking Points:** Generates "Key Talking Points" summarizing the applicant's strongest arguments, grounded with real-time Google Search for facts and adhering to PSW eligibility rules.

Workflow & Logic:

3.  **Analyze:** The user's profile, the question, and the final transcript are sent to the AI with a System Instruction (`analyzeAnswer`) to act as a "Senior Australian Visa Officer." The AI is specifically instructed to check for incorrect understanding of PSW rights based on the student's course level.
4.  **Feedback:** The AI evaluates the transcript against a 4-point rubric (Tone, Clarity, Relevance, Persuasiveness), assigns a score (1-10), and generates structured HTML feedback separated into positive points and areas for improvement.

[GENERATIVE_ENGINE_OPTIMISATION_(GEO)_STRATEGY]
Architectural-Philosophy: The application employs a "Schema-First, Entity-Centric" design. It is not merely a webpage but a structured, multi-layered knowledge graph architected for explicit and unambiguous consumption by AI crawlers and generative models. This is achieved via multiple interlinked JSON-LD script blocks using the `@graph` attribute in `index.html`.

--- Layer 1: Foundational Schema (Core Application & Business Identity) ---
Description: Establishes the core entities: who we are, what this tool is, and where we are located.
-   **`WebApplication`:** Defines the AI tool itself, its features, and its provider (`EEC`). Crucially, it uses `subjectOf` to link to all other primary content schemas, acting as the central node.
-   **`EducationalOrganization` (Parent):** A single, authoritative schema for EEC, including its founding date, description, social media links (`sameAs`), and an `aggregateRating`.
-   **`EducationalOrganization` (Branches):** 26 distinct schemas, one for each physical branch. Each has a unique `@id`, Google Maps CID URL, telephone, and address. They are linked to the parent via `parentOrganization` and aggregated under the parent's `hasPart` property. One branch is designated with `isHeadOffice: true`.
-   **Strategy:** This creates an unassailable local SEO moat and a massive, verifiable entity graph for Google's Knowledge Panel and local search results.

--- Layer 2: Core Content & How-To Schema ---
Description: Structures the application's primary informational and instructional content to capture high-intent "how-to" and "what-is" queries.
-   **`HowTo` (Tool Usage):** A step-by-step guide on using the AI tool.
-   **`HowTo` (Document Checklist):** A detailed, sectioned checklist for GS visa documents. This directly targets a primary user pain point and search query.
-   **`FAQPage`:** Structures common questions about GS and GTE into a format ideal for "People Also Ask" snippets.
-   **`VideoObject`:** Marks up the embedded YouTube guide, making it eligible for video-rich results and associating it directly with the application's context.
-   **Strategy:** Capture users at the problem-aware stage by providing direct, structured answers to their most pressing questions.

--- Layer 3: Topical Authority & Rich Snippet Schema ---
Description: Broadens the application's topical authority beyond just "visa interviews" into the entire student lifecycle.
-   **`ItemList` (Visa Requirements):** Structures the 6 core visa requirements into a list, making the content highly eligible for list-based rich snippets.
-   **`Article` (Student Life):** Defines the "Navigating Student Life" guide as a formal article, with `articleSection` properties detailing its sub-topics (Accommodation, Work, etc.).
-   **`Article` (City Comparison):** Marks up the city comparison content, specifying the cities covered in `articleSection`.
-   **Strategy:** Demonstrate comprehensive knowledge across the entire topic cluster of "Studying in Australia," signaling to search engines that this is an authoritative destination.

--- Layer 4: E-E-A-T Signal Amplification Schema ---
Description: The most advanced layer, designed to explicitly prove Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.
-   **`Person` Schema:** Creates distinct entities for the five key experts: Amit Jalan, CA Madhav Gupta, Anirudh Gupta, Ridhika Jalan, and Mohita Gupta. Each includes `jobTitle`, `description`, `image`, a `url` to their LinkedIn profile, and a `worksFor` property linking them to the parent `EducationalOrganization` schema. Content schemas (like `WebPage`) then reference these experts via `@id` in their `author` property.
-   **`Review` Schema:** Marks up the three student testimonials as formal `Review` objects. Each review has a `ratingValue`, `author`, `reviewBody`, and an `itemReviewed` property that links directly back to the `WebApplication` schema.
-   **Strategy:** This layer provides verifiable, structured proof of the human expertise behind the tool and the positive outcomes it generates, directly addressing Google's E-E-A-T guidelines in a machine-readable format.
