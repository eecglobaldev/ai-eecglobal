        courseUnderstanding: "I have chosen the TAFE NSW Diploma as it is a practical, hands-on course that prepares me for direct entry into the second year of the Bachelor of IT at UTS. I understand that as a Diploma student, I am not eligible for post-study work rights after this 1-year course. My eligibility for PSW will only begin after I have completed the full Bachelor of IT degree at UTS, as per my packaged offer. This pathway is a common and respected route to a university degree in Australia.",
        livingUnderstanding: "I know Sydney is an expensive city. My plan is to live in shared accommodation in a suburb like Parramatta, which is well-connected by train to the TAFE campus. I am fully aware of the 48-hour per fortnight work limit and my father's business and an education loan will cover all my expenses.",
        whyAustralia: "Australia's VET sector, particularly TAFE, is world-renowned for its quality and industry focus. This practical approach is better for me than a purely theoretical university degree in India, especially since I am changing fields from commerce to IT. The pathway program provides a structured and supportive transition.",
        whyThisInstitution: "TAFE NSW is the largest vocational training provider in Australia and has direct, formal pathway agreements with top universities like UTS. This provides a secure and guaranteed route to a bachelor's degree, which is a safer option for me given my academic background. I chose TAFE over private colleges for its government backing and reputation.",
        whyNotIndia: "In India, diploma courses are often not well-integrated with university degrees. After my 12th, I lack the science background for direct entry into good engineering colleges. The Australian TAFE pathway is a unique system that allows me to build the necessary foundation and then transfer seamlessly to a high-quality university program.",
        careerBenefit: "This pathway is a strategic career move. The Diploma will give me practical, job-ready skills, and the Bachelor's degree from UTS will provide the theoretical depth. This combination will make me highly employable in India's IT sector, which values both practical skills and a strong university degree.",
        afterStudyPlan: "After completing my Bachelor's degree, I will return to India. My goal is to work as a Network Administrator or IT Support Specialist in Vadodara or Ahmedabad. I aim to work for a mid-sized IT firm, where I can apply my skills to help businesses like my father's grow. I expect a starting salary of ₹6-8 Lakhs per annum.",

The program's focus on evidence-based practice and research, evident in subjects like 'PHYT3000 - Evidence-Based Clinical Practice', is a key reason for my choice.

It is a Go8 university, signifying research excellence. I chose UQ over the University of Sydney because of its stronger emphasis on rehabilitation sciences and its renowned clinical facilities. The subtropical climate in Brisbane is also similar to my home in Kerala.",
        whyNotIndia: "While physiotherapy is a growing field in India, the curriculum often lacks the depth of research and evidence-based practice taught in Australia.
