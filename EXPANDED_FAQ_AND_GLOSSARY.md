## Part A: Expanded FAQs

### FAQ 9: What is an INZ credibility interview?

**Answer**:
An INZ credibility interview is a formal assessment conducted by Immigration New Zealand to verify whether your intention to study in New Zealand is genuine, realistic, and lawful. Indian students are frequently selected for this interview because India is considered a higher-risk source country, making credibility assessment a standard part of the visa process rather than an exception.

The interview focuses on five core areas: your academic background, relevance of the chosen course, financial capacity, understanding of New Zealand as a study destination, and post-study intentions. Visa officers assess whether your academic progression makes sense, whether your funds are legitimate and accessible, and whether your career plans align logically with your qualification.

Interviews are usually conducted online or by phone and can last 15–30 minutes. Inconsistent answers, vague career plans, or unclear financial explanations are the most common reasons students fail credibility checks. Importantly, officers compare your interview responses with your SOP, application form, and supporting documents.

Structured preparation using personalised questions significantly improves performance. Practising realistic interview scenarios helps you communicate confidently, stay consistent, and demonstrate genuine intent clearly.

### FAQ 10: What is Genuine Temporary Entry (GTE)?

**Answer**:
Genuine Temporary Entry (GTE) is a core evaluation used by Immigration New Zealand to determine whether you genuinely intend to study in New Zealand for a legitimate educational purpose. It does not prohibit future migration, but it requires that your current intention is lawful, transparent, and aligned with student visa conditions.

INZ evaluates GTE by reviewing your academic history, employment background, financial stability, family ties in India, and long-term career plans. Officers look for logical progression—such as a relevant bachelor’s degree followed by a master’s program—and clear justification for choosing New Zealand over other countries.

Your Statement of Purpose and credibility interview responses play a decisive role in GTE assessment. Any contradiction between documents, unrealistic salary expectations, or unexplained career shifts may weaken your case. Strong applications clearly explain how the qualification benefits your career in India or internationally while respecting visa conditions.

Demonstrating GTE is about clarity, consistency, and credibility—not memorised answers.

### FAQ 11: What documents are required for a New Zealand student visa?

**Answer**:
A New Zealand student visa requires a complete set of academic, financial, and personal documents. Submitting accurate and consistent documentation is critical, as incomplete or unclear files are a major cause of visa delays and refusals.

Key documents include a valid passport (with at least six months’ validity beyond your intended stay), an Offer of Place from an NZQA-approved institution, proof of tuition fee payment, and evidence of Funds to Support (NZD $20,000 per year for living expenses). Financial evidence typically includes six months of bank statements, education loan sanction letters (if applicable), sponsor declarations, CA certificates, and Income Tax Returns for the last three years.

Additional mandatory documents include a Statement of Purpose, medical examination results submitted via eMedical, and a Police Clearance Certificate for study durations exceeding 24 months. All documents must be genuine, clearly scanned, and mutually consistent.

Early preparation and professional document review reduce the risk of credibility concerns.

### FAQ 12: How do I apply for a New Zealand student visa online?

**Answer**:
New Zealand student visa applications are submitted entirely online through Immigration New Zealand’s portal using a RealMe account. You can apply only after receiving an Offer of Place and paying the required tuition fees.

The process involves creating a RealMe account, completing the online student visa form, uploading all required documents, and paying the visa application fee of NZD $375 (approximately ₹19,500). After submission, you will be instructed to provide biometrics at a VFS Global centre in India and complete a medical examination with an INZ-approved panel physician.

INZ may request additional documents or schedule a credibility interview depending on your profile. Standard processing time is 25–30 working days, though applications submitted during peak intake periods (January–March) may take longer.

Submitting a complete and well-explained application from the beginning significantly improves processing efficiency.

### FAQ 13: What are common reasons for New Zealand student visa refusal?

**Answer**:
Most New Zealand student visa refusals occur due to credibility or financial concerns rather than academic ability. The most common reason is failure to satisfy the Genuine Temporary Entry requirement, often caused by unclear career goals, weak academic progression, or inconsistent interview responses.

Financial issues are another major factor. Insufficient funds, unexplained large deposits, unreliable sponsors, or poorly documented education loans frequently lead to refusals. Discrepancies between your SOP, financial documents, and interview answers raise serious red flags.

Health and character issues—such as failing medical requirements or submitting an incorrect Police Clearance Certificate—can also result in refusal. Importantly, many refusals are preventable with honest documentation, realistic planning, and proper interview preparation.

Understanding INZ expectations early is the most effective way to minimise refusal risk.
