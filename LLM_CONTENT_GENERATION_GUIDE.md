## 📝 Existing FAQ Structure

### Current FAQs (8 total)

#### 1. Financial Category

**Question**: "How much money is required for New Zealand student visa?"

**Answer** (Example - 150-250 words):
"For a New Zealand student visa, you need to demonstrate financial capacity through the Funds to Support (FTS) scheme. This requires showing NZD $20,000 (approximately ₹10-11 lakhs) per year for living expenses, which covers accommodation, food, transport, and personal expenses. In addition to living expenses, you must also show proof of tuition fees payment, which typically ranges from NZD $22,000-$50,000 per year depending on your institution and program level. The visa application fee is NZD $375 (approximately ₹19,500), and you should budget approximately NZD $500 for the mandatory medical examination. Financial evidence can be demonstrated through bank statements (minimum 6 months), education loan sanctions, or sponsor declarations with CA-certified financial documents. It's important to note that these funds must be readily available and not tied up in fixed deposits or investments that cannot be liquidated quickly."

**Category**: Financial  
**Key Points**: FTS scheme, amounts, document types, liquidity requirement

---

**Question**: "How much funds for NZ visa?"

**Answer** (Example - 150-250 words):
"For a New Zealand student visa, you need to demonstrate NZD $20,000 (approximately ₹10.5 lakhs) per year for living expenses under the Funds to Support (FTS) scheme. This amount is in addition to your tuition fees, which typically range from NZD $22,000 to $50,000 per year depending on your institution and program. The FTS requirement ensures you can support yourself during your studies without financial hardship. You can demonstrate this through bank statements showing sufficient funds, education loan sanctions from recognized banks, or sponsor declarations with CA-certified financial documents. The funds must be readily available and not tied up in investments. For a typical 2-year Master's program, you would need to show approximately NZD $40,000 for living expenses plus your tuition fees for the entire program duration."

**Category**: Financial

#### 2. Visa Process Category

**Question**: "What is the processing time for NZ student visa from India?"

**Answer** (Example - 150-250 words):
"The standard processing time for a New Zealand student visa from India is 25-30 working days from the date of complete application submission. However, this timeline can extend to 60+ days during peak application seasons (typically January-March when most intakes begin) or if Immigration New Zealand requests additional documentation or clarification. Factors that can delay processing include incomplete applications, missing documents, requests for credibility interviews, or the need for additional verification. Priority processing is available for an additional fee, which can reduce processing time to approximately 15 working days. To ensure faster processing, submit a complete application with all required documents, ensure your financial documents are clear and properly certified, and respond promptly to any requests from INZ. EEC maintains an average processing time of 26 days for applications submitted through our consultancy."

**Category**: Visa Process  
**Key Points**: Standard timeline, peak seasons, delays, priority processing, EEC average

#### 3. Work Rights Category

**Question**: "Can I work while studying in New Zealand?"

**Answer** (Example - 150-250 words):
"Yes, international students in New Zealand can work up to 20 hours per week during the academic term and full-time (40+ hours) during scheduled holidays and semester breaks. This work right is automatically included with your student visa, so you don't need to apply separately. Students enrolled in research-based programs such as Masters by Research or PhD programs can work unlimited hours, as their studies are more flexible. Your partner or spouse can also apply for an open work visa, which allows them to work full-time for any employer in New Zealand without restrictions. Working while studying helps offset living costs and provides valuable work experience. The minimum wage in New Zealand is NZD $23.15 per hour (as of 2024), so part-time work can significantly help with expenses. However, it's important to balance work and studies, as maintaining good academic performance is crucial for visa renewal and future work visa applications."

**Category**: Work Rights  
**Key Points**: Hours allowed, automatic inclusion, research programs, partner rights, minimum wage, balance

---

**Question**: "Can spouse work in NZ?"

**Answer** (Example - 150-250 words):
"Yes, partners and spouses of eligible student visa holders in New Zealand can apply for an open work visa that allows full-time employment with any employer. This is a significant advantage of studying in New Zealand compared to other countries. Your partner's work visa is typically valid for the same duration as your student visa, and they can work in any role without restrictions. This means your partner can contribute to household income, gain work experience, and build their career while you study. The open work visa doesn't require a job offer or employer sponsorship, making it easy for your partner to find employment. This dual-income opportunity makes studying in New Zealand more affordable and provides a strong foundation for your family's future in the country. If you transition to a Post-Study Work Visa after graduation, your partner can also apply for a corresponding work visa."

**Category**: Work Rights

#### 4. Post-Study Category

**Question**: "What happens after completing studies in New Zealand?"

**Answer** (Example - 150-250 words):
"After completing your studies in New Zealand, you can apply for a Post-Study Work Visa (PSWV), which is one of the most generous post-study work pathways among English-speaking countries. The duration of your PSWV depends on your qualification level: Bachelor's degree graduates (NQF Level 7+) receive a 3-year open work visa, while diploma graduates (Level 5-6) typically receive 1-2 years. This is an open work visa, meaning you can work for any employer in any role without needing sponsorship. During this period, you can gain professional experience that counts toward the Skilled Migrant Category (SMC) residence pathway, which can lead to permanent residency. According to Education New Zealand statistics, 78% of international graduates secure employment within 6 months of completion, with an average starting salary of NZD $65,000 for degree holders. This combination of work rights, PR pathway, and strong employment outcomes makes New Zealand uniquely attractive compared to Australia's 2-year PSW, UK's 2-year Graduate Route, or Canada's variable PGWP duration."

**Category**: Post-Study  
**Key Points**: PSWV duration, open work visa, SMC pathway, employment stats, comparison

---

**Question**: "NZ Post-Study Work Visa duration?"

**Answer** (Example - 150-250 words):
"The New Zealand Post-Study Work Visa (PSWV) duration depends on your qualification level. Bachelor's degree graduates (NQF Level 7 and above) receive a 3-year open work visa, which is the longest post-study work visa among English-speaking countries. This is significantly better than Australia's 2-year PSW, UK's 2-year Graduate Route, or Canada's variable PGWP duration. Diploma graduates (Level 5-6) typically receive 1-2 years depending on their program. The PSWV is an open work visa, meaning you can work for any employer in any role without needing sponsorship or job offers. This extended work period gives you ample time to gain professional experience, build your career, and potentially qualify for the Skilled Migrant Category residence pathway. The 3-year duration is particularly valuable as it allows you to establish yourself professionally and financially in New Zealand."

#### 5. Tool Category
